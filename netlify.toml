# -------------------------------------------------------
# Neon plugin disabled (commented)
#
# The Neon extension is causing a build-failing error in onPreBuild when it queries an anonymous Neon DB.
# To unblock builds immediately, the neon-buildhooks plugin configuration has been commented out here.
# If you need Neon during builds, re-provision a persistent Neon DB (not anonymous), ensure NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL
# and NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED environment variables are set in Netlify, and re-enable the plugin (or
# reinstall the Neon extension) from the Netlify UI. Also consider removing the Neon extension from the Netlify
# site (Site settings → Extensions) if you no longer need it.
